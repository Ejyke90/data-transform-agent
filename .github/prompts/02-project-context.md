# Project Context

## Repository Purpose

The data-transform-agent repository is designed for building intelligent data transformation agents that can process, validate, and transform data efficiently.

## Key Concepts

- **Data Agents**: Autonomous components that handle specific data transformation tasks
- **Transformation Pipelines**: Sequential or parallel data processing workflows
- **Validation**: Ensuring data quality and integrity throughout the transformation process
- **Error Handling**: Robust mechanisms for handling data anomalies and processing errors

## Technology Stack

- Python (primary language for data processing)
- Standard data processing libraries (pandas, numpy, etc.)
- Agent-based architecture patterns

## Development Principles

- Modularity: Keep transformation logic independent and reusable
- Testability: Write comprehensive tests for transformations
- Observability: Log and monitor transformation processes
- Scalability: Design for handling varying data volumes
